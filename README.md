### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A while ago, I started making websites such as for [conferences](https://jimenezdaniel.com/encounter), started [freelancing](https://jimenezdaniel.com/freelancing), and wrote about the [process](https://medium.com/@jimenezd305/design-and-website-creation-case-study-a3cfb3182e89).


*I'm still creating because I believe that what I create can make lives better.*
